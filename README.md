# FreeCodeCamp---JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-Beta-Solutions-

This repository contains my solutions for various FreeCodeCamp challenges. Please note the following:

**Code Scope:** The solutions provided are specifically for the code required in the text boxes shown in each challenge. They are not complete files but only the relevant code snippets needed to pass the tests.

**Commented Code**: If a particular step does not require any code, or if there are specific lines or steps that need to be removed or left out, I have commented them out using double slashes //. This helps maintain clarity and ensure the code provided is directly applicable to the challenge.

**Finding Steps**: If you are searching for a specific step and cannot find it in sequence, try using the search functionality by typing Step X, where X is the number of the step you are looking for.
